## üí° About ToGrow
ToGrow is an **AI-powered Chrome extension** developed during cmd-f 2025 that helps **neurodivergent individuals** break down overwhelming tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

## üå± Key Features
- **AI Task Breakdown**: Powered by Gemini API to transform large tasks into actionable steps
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design to reduce cognitive load
- **Chrome Extension Format**: Easily accessible while working on any website
- **Plant Growth Visualization**: Visual representation of progress to provide positive reinforcement
- **Chrome Sync Storage**: Syncs tasks across devices, reducing need for backend storage

## üèÜ Recognition
ToGrow was recognized as one of the top projects at cmd-f 2025 hackathon hosted by nwPlus at UBC!
